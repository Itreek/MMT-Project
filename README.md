## Role of Culture in pop music


Music can express a range of emotions, from sadness to love or joy. It has the powerful ability to reflect and influence one’s emotional state. Cross-culture applicability of perceived moods introduces major research questions like, do people with different cultural backgrounds perceive mood in music differently? Is there a more robust agreement within and across cultures for certain moods compared to others?  

As a part of the project we have replicated the results of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00768 to the Indian population.

We curated a dataset of Indian songs with 15 songs from North culture and 15 songs from South culture. (Refer to the report for a detailed overview of song selection). We divided 120 songs into 6 blocks.
A seperate survey was conducted for each of the six blocks. From the data obtained from the survey the following results were analysed.

- Familiarity ratings of Indian raters, South raters, North raters
- Preference ratings of Indian raters, South raters, North raters
- Familiarity vs Preference scatter plots
- Within country agreement for Indian participants, South participants, North participants
- Agreement by Song origin
- Between country agreement for South vs North
